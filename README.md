# Bike-Sharing

## Overview
In this project we are analyzing data from a bike sharing business to present to investors and show that this is a solid business proposal.
To solidify the proposal we will use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype and create visualizations of our data. Once we have the correct information, we will:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
